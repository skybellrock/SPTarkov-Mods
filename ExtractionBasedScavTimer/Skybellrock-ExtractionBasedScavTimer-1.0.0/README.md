Allows you to increase or decrease the scav cooldown depending on the outcome of your last PMC raid.

You can use this however you want, but the original thought is to balance scav player access for a hardcoreish playthrough. This is achieved by limiting access to the scav player by having a long base timer, increasing the timer slightly upon succesful exfil and a ton upon run-through, while reducing it a lot upon death. This means you technically can get access to your scav player even if you survive a lot, as long as you spend enough time in your inventory or in raid. However, it will be much less and therefore encourage you to play as your PMC as long as your raids have been going well. If your PMC raids have not been going well you will quickly find that the scav player is ready at your disposal. 

The principle is that the scav should be a last resort. At Fence rep 6, Intelligence Center level 3 and Hideout Management skill maxed, the base time is 38 minutes. So with the default increase of 15 min per succesful exfil and -60 min per death you will gain access to the scav player every time you die as long as you have not had more than 3-4ish consecutive exfils, depending on how long you spend in each raid. Or every two exfils as long as your raids + time in inventory exceeds 20 minutes. If you spend on average longer than 15 minutes in raid + in inventory between raids, you will slowly creep towards an open scav regardless. It is entirely possible to eventually have frequent scav runs and take advantage of your scav rep.

Alternatively you could configure it to reward your scav time for sucessful exfils or punish you for dying. Honestly make it whatever you want.

The config is in minutes.
Values for modifiers can be positive to add time to the scav timer and negative to remove from it.
baseScavResetTime - The default time the scav timer takes without taking into consideration Hideout upgrades, skills and Fence rep.
scavTimeSurviveModifier - add/remove to scav timer when succesful exfil
scavTimeRunThroughModifier - add/remove to scav timer when run-through
scavTimeDeadModifier - add/remove to scav timer upon death
