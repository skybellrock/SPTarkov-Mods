Also A big thanks to him for helping me solve a few issues along the way.

A huge thanks to fellow modder Kobrakon (https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/user/7008-kobrakon/?highlight=kobra) for being an immense help to me in creating version 1.1.0. Without him, I surely wouldn't have been able to achieve what I wanted.
