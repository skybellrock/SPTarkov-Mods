Patch 1.0.2
Fixed a typo that made the 9x18mm malfunction stat much higher than intended
Fixed a typo that made the 5.45x39mm malfunction stat much lower than intended
Increased Flare penetration value to 25, so it can ignore armor level one and 2 with a fair chance to penetrate armor class 3
The damage dealt by explosive shrapnel from the 12/70 and 20/70 Buckshot has been halved
.366 TKM and .357 Magnum are now categorized under the medium calibres category instead of the previous large and small respectively, while 12/70 and 20/70 Buckshot are now categorized under the large calibres category instead of the previous medium, which affect their stats. A higher calibre group means their malfunction, heat and durability burn stats became significantly worse, and a lower calibre group means those stats have become significantly better
